## 🖼️ How to Use

1. **Upload an image**  
   Drag & drop or click to upload the picture you want to transform.

2. **Adjust the sliders**  
   - **Grid size** – controls how many cat tiles make up the image (smaller = more detail, larger = chunkier cats).  
   - **Image size** – set the resolution of the final mosaic image.
   - **Image variance** – adjust how closely cat tiles match the original colors (low = precise, high = more variety).  

3. **Pick color space**  
   Only`RGB` is supported right now, more modes coming soon!

4. **Preview tiles used**  
   See which cat photos were chosen to build your mosaic.

5. **Click “Build Photomosaic”**  
   Generate your cat-powered masterpiece 🐾✨.
